# NPRI Dataset Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It is designed to explore pollutant emissions data across Canada and extract meaningful insights using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Project Overview

The project aims to:
- Understand patterns and trends in pollutant emissions reported in the NPRI dataset.
- Use Python-based tools to clean, process, and analyze the dataset.
- Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
- Support environmental decision-making and raise awareness using data insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development and reporting

## Dataset

The NPRI dataset is Canada's inventory of pollutant releases to air, water, and land by industrial facilities. It is publicly available through [Canada’s Open Government Portal](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook files in a local environment or via Google Colab.
3. Run the cells to see data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
